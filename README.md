Above & Beyond:
What I believe was above and beyond for this project was how I used a variety of different ways
to present information. I've used buttons to represent information for some areas such as degrees and resources then 
using panels for the minors to perform the same task. I've used tabs for some sections then 
a combobox for another and lastly to dynamically adding multiple panels and elements
to act as boxes. 
I've also utilizied both static and dynamic creation
for elements and trying my best to present the information in a aesthetically pleasing way: 
creating the people section, news section, and more!
Lastly, I tried a variety of different coding techniques and methods. 
I've used one constructor that accepts multiple parameters and checks for null values (EachDegree form) while also having
two constructors (EachResearch form) that accept different parameters.
